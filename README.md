### Description:
The Text Manipulation Tool is a versatile web application that allows users to perform various operations on text. Whether you need to format text, analyze its properties, or even have it read aloud, this tool has you covered. Developed using React.js, this project provides a user-friendly interface for text processing.

### Features:

* Text-to-Speech: Have the text read aloud with the "Speak" feature.
* Capitalize Words: Capitalize the first letter of each word in the text.
* Text Reversal: Reverse the order of characters in the text.
* Word Count: Get a word and character count for the text, along with an estimated reading time.
* Dark Mode: Enable or disable dark mode for a personalized viewing experience.

### Usage:

2. Choose from a variety of text manipulation options.
3. View the modified text, word count, and reading time in real-time.
4. Customize your experience with the built-in dark mode feature.

### Motivation:
This project was created to provide a convenient and accessible tool for users to manipulate text in a variety of ways. Whether you're a writer, student, or anyone dealing with text regularly, this tool can help streamline your tasks while offering a pleasant dark mode for those late-night sessions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
